`scala-chart` (formerly `sfreechart`) version 0.2.0 includes the following changes:

-   obviously the artifact name changed from `sfreechart` to `scala-chart`, also the `groupID` /
    organization changed from `com.github.wookietreiber.sfreechart` to `com.github.wookietreiber`,
    this changes the `sbt` usage to:

        libraryDependencies += "com.github.wookietreiber" %% "scala-chart" % "0.2.0"

    ... and the `maven` usage to:

        <dependency>
          <groupId>com.github.wookietreiber</groupId>
          <artifactId>scala-chart_${scala.version}</artifactId>
          <version>latest.integration</version>
        </dependency>

-   the base package changed from `org.sfree.chart` to `scalax.chart`, which changes the basic
    imports to:

        import org.sfree.chart._
        import org.sfree.chart.Charting._

-   the selfless trait `ChartFactory` has been renamed to `ChartFactories`
-   own wrappers for charts with `peer` access to the original `JFreeChart`
    -   all factories return these chart types
    -   these include a `Buffer` for `subtitles` (includes the legends)
    -   most of the chart functionality has been modularized into separate traits
-   orienting charts is now done via `scala.swing.Orientable`
-   label and tooltip generation is now done via functions
-   new stacked xy bar chart factory
-   new converter to `CategoryTableXYDataset`
-   support box and whisker charts / datasets
-   most of the accessors / mutators use `Option` where applicable


For more information about `scala-chart` usage have a look at the
[README](https://github.com/wookietreiber/scala-chart#readme) and at the
[API](http://wookietreiber.github.com/scala-chart/latest/api/index.html).
