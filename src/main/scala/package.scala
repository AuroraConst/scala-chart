/** This package contains wrappers for the [[http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/ JFreeChart]] library.
  *
  * == Imports ==
  *
  * Imports are provided in groups:
  *
  * [[org.sfree.chart.Charting]] contains all enrichments. This import is the recommended starting
  * point for working with sfreechart:
  *
  * {{{
  * import org.sfree.chart.Charting._
  * val data = Seq((0,0),(1,1),(2,2)).toXYSeriesCollection("some data")
  * val chart = LineChart(data)
  * }}}
  *
  * [[org.sfree.chart.Views]] contains all implicit views / conversions. Use this import with care,
  * because of ambiguous implicit conversions. It is better to just import the specific conversion
  * you need:
  *
  * {{{
  * import org.sfree.chart.Charting._
  * import org.sfree.chart.Views.asXYSeriesCollection
  * val data = Seq((0,0),(1,1),(2,2))
  * val chart = LineChart(data)
  * }}}
