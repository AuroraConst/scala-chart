package org.sfree

/** This package contains wrappers for the [[http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/ JFreeChart]] library.
  * The basic starting point is to import the [[org.sfree.chart.Charting]] object:
  *
  * {{{
  * import org.sfree.chart.Charting._
  * }}}
  *
  * With this import you can convert Scala collections to JFreeChart datasets and use chart
  * factories:
  *
  * {{{
  * val data = Seq((1,2),(2,4),(3,6),(4,8))
  * val dataset = data.toXYSeriesCollection("some points")
  * val chart = XYLineChart(dataset, title = "My Chart of Some Points")
  * }}}
  *
  * There are also implicit conversions / views available in the [[org.sfree.chart.views]] package,
  * but they are not contained by [[org.sfree.chart.Charting]], because of ambiguity issues with
  * implicit conversions.
